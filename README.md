# Protein Folding Simulation
A simplistic simulation of protein folding.

Written for fun, based on Giordano Computational Physics Q11.1.1

Check output.avi for an animated example!

### update:
I have since been taking a biophysics course, and so have made some adjustments based on the things I've learnt. For example, I decreased the interaction energies between Amino Acids and added interaction with water such that the folding will hopefully be driven more by PvsNP rather than interactions between the AAs themselves. I have also started randomly assigning interaction energies and polarity.
